**Query**: Shipped units By Location:
Identify the number of units that have been shipped, categorized by different locations. Gain insights into the distribution of shipped units across various locations.

**Solution**:
**OLD APPROACH:** Becauls this query wonâ€™t include shipping charges(i.e the adjustments)
```sql
SELECT
	s.ORIGIN_FACILITY_ID as location,
	COUNT(os.QUANTITY) as total_units
FROM
order_shipment os
JOIN shipment s ON
os.SHIPMENT_ID = s.SHIPMENT_ID AND s.STATUS_ID = 'SHIPMENT_SHIPPED'
GROUP BY
	s.ORIGIN_FACILITY_ID;
```
**CORRECTED APPROACH:**
```sql
SELECT
	s.ORIGIN_FACILITY_ID as location,
	SUM(si.QUANTITY) as total_units
FROM shipment s
JOIN shipment_item si ON
s.shipment_id = si.shipment_id AND s.STATUS_ID = 'SHIPMENT_SHIPPED'
GROUP BY
	s.ORIGIN_FACILITY_ID;
```
