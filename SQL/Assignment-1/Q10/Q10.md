JOIN order_item oi ON
	oh.order_id = oi.order_id AND oh.status_id not in ('ORDER_COMPLETED', 'ORDER_CANCELLED')
JOIN order_item_ship_group_assoc oisga ON
	oi.order_id = oisga.order_id
	and oi.order_item_seq_id = oisga.order_item_seq_id
JOIN order_item_ship_group oisg ON
	oisg.order_id = oisga.order_id
	and oisg.ship_group_seq_id = oisga.ship_group_seq_id and oisg.facility_id <> "_NA_";
